What is the visual representation of music? Should there be one? If so, what is the ground truth of what a piece of music should look like to the human eyes? Rather than exploring the answers, we pretend we know the ground truth by hardcoding the 30,000 songs in our database with a color based on their genre -- the "class" that is assigned to them by the music industry's standard. Then, we explore how the "factual" matches with the "factivity". In this case, we train a Neutral Network on the lyrics embeddings of each song with its assigned color, and then see how the colors diverge from their original forms, showing the interesting relationship between a song's genre and its lyrical meaning. The results show both conformity and non-conformity -- we see artists who are dominant by one color (The Doors, Cardi B, etc), and artists that are surprisingly colorful (Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, etc). In the end, we want to leave it for the viewers to explore the music world through the abstract representation of colors.
